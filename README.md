# openquest-withmusic
 Here is a modest attempt to put music into this open-source ScummC Game, an occasion to deal with iMuse routines.
 The ScummC compiler, plus the original port of this game, can be found on this repository : https://github.com/AlbanBedel/scummc/

 * Many thanks to Alban Bedel (https://github.com/AlbanBedel) to make this compiler alive
 * Special mention to Happy Ferret (https://github.com/Happy-Ferret) ... his question here (https://github.com/AlbanBedel/scummc/issues/9) have motived my decision  to snoop deeper into Scumm v6 iMuse Routines !
